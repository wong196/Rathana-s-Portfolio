<h1>Best Movies According to Rathana</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<h3>Vikings (TV Series)</h3>
<p>The best historical series, featuring amazing scenery of forests, mountains, waterfalls, and diverse cultures, which differ from mine in Southeast Asia. I love the mixed vibe this series offers: dark, cold, and green. While watching, I experience joy, fear, and suspicion. Every episode is an adventure toward something new and interesting. From the small town of Kattegat, the journey expands to England (Northumbria, Wessex, Mercia), the Gates of Frankia, the Arabian Desert, the Kievan Rus, Greenland, and America.</p>
<h3>Three Kingdoms 2010 (Samkok)</h3>
<p>This series presents many plots about war to learn from. It transports me back to China's old days after the collapse of the Han Dynasty and makes me appreciate China's history, people, and culture much more.</p>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>I know many people already like it. The best parts I enjoy the most are the scenes in Winterfell, the Night's Watch, and Beyond the Wall.</p>
